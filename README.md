How It Works:
The HTML creates a 3x3 grid for the game.
The CSS styles the grid and ensures a visually appealing layout.
The JavaScript handles the game logic:
It tracks the state of the board and the current player.
It checks for a winner or a tie after each move.
It provides functionality to restart the game.
